# race-simulator-wafoe
A "Racing Simulator" game to learn object-oriented programming in C#. As an Infrastructure Design & Security student at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences, I felt like I did not gain enough experience in programming. This is why I chose to follow the C# course at my university. I have some slight experience with coding in HTML, PHP, and Python, so C# was quite a challenge. However, it was a fun project and I feel like I have made a compelling solution.
 
## Goal
To be able to win a racing competition, IT resources are increasingly used. For example, a simulator can make predictions about a competition. These predictions allow teams to deploy resources better and more efficiently. Not all competitors have a simulator yet. This is a gap in the market. This project aims to develop a simulator for a competition.

## My simulator
My simulator is themed around the popular 1992 Nintendo game "Super Mario Kart" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. My road simulation and characters have been borrowed and/or heavily inspired by the classic game. 
### Features
Some of the features in my simulator, but not limited to, are:
* A track builder to easily craft your races
* Fully modular design using the MVC-model and SOLID-principles
* Live race statistics during the simulation
  * Name of the track
  * Amount of laps
  * Amount of sections
  * Amount of racers
  * Race timer
  * Name, team, speed, performance, quality, and broken state of the participant
  * Racing positions
  * Lap times and full race times
  * Points per race and for the whole competition
* Up to the 16-bit limit of laps, races, etc
* Maximum of 12 racers per competition
* A "celebration" ending screen consisting of the top 3 drivers
